It produces the world's most powerful, high-energy neutrino beam and provides proton and neutron beams for various experiments, R&D programs as well as cancer treatment. Several test beams and test areas are available to university and industrial researchers, including:

Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF) delivers high-energy beams via two versatile beamlines (MTest and MCenter) in which users can test equipment or detectors. The MTest primary beamline delivers high energy protons (120 GeV) at moderate intensities (~1-300 kHz). This beam can also be targeted to create secondary, or even tertiary particle beams of energies down to below 1 GeV, consisting of pions, muons, and/or electrons. The MCenter beamline is similar.

The MuCool Test Area is a unique accelerator R&D facility. It includes a cryoplant in a surface building, an underground experimental hall, a beamline to bring a 400-MeV proton beam into the hall, a clean room in the hall for component assembly, 201 and 805 MHz rf power, several rf cavities, a 5-Tesla superconducting solenoid for cavity tests, diagnostic instrumentation for radiation measurements, and infrastructure for liquid hydrogen.

An advanced accelerator test facility is being developed. It will enable a broad range of beam-based experiments to study fundamental limitations to beam intensity and to develop transformative approaches to particle-beam generation, acceleration and manipulation. 

The Neutron Therapy Facility provides a moderate intensity, broad energy spectrum neutron beam that can be used for short term irradiations for radiobiology (cells) and material science investigations.

Centered at Barrow and extending to the south (to the vicinity of Atqasuk), west (to the vicinity of Wainwright), and east (towards Oliktok), the NSA site has become a focal point for atmospheric and ecological research activity on the North Slope. The principal instrumented facility was installed near Barrow in 1997, followed by a smaller remote site in Atqasuk in 1999, which operated through 2010.

High latitude data are being used to refine models and parameterizations as they relate to the Arctic and are receiving increasing attention as the interactions of the atmosphere-ocean climate system become better understood. In addition, other compelling scientific reasons to study climatic change at high latitudes are listed below:

Ice (including snow) is the predominant form of condensed water most of the year, both in the air and on the surface. Ice and snow scatter, transmit, and absorb sunlight and radiant heat much differently than water
There is very little water vapor in the atmosphere, changing the impact of the atmosphere on the propagation of radiant energy, particularly radiant energy propagating upwards from the surface, and on the performance of some atmospheric remote sensing instruments.
The major &quot;&quot;pumps&quot;&quot; for the global ocean currents are at high latitudes, and there is good reason to believe that those pumps will be affected by climate-related changes in the atmosphere.
High latitude atmospheric processes over both land and sea must be characterized for incorporation into global climate models.&quot;",User Facility,http://www.arm.gov/sites/nsa,wanda.ferrel@science.doe.gov,(301) 903-0043

Scientists are using the information obtained from the SGP to improve cloud and radiative models and parameterizations and, thereby, the performance of atmospheric general circulation models used for climate research.

Deployment of the first instrumentation to the SGP site occurred in the spring of 1992, just 24 months after the ARM Program was established. The site was dedicated in November 1992. Additional instrumentation and data processing capabilities have been incrementally added in the succeeding years. In 2001, the site was rededicated in the name of Dr. Frederick Luther (1943-1986), who made outstanding contributions to the field of atmospheric research and furthering our understanding of atmospheric radiation and its interactions with clouds, aerosols, and gases. The SGP site consists of in situ and remote-sensing instrument clusters arrayed across approximately 55,000 square miles (143,000 square kilometers) in north-central Oklahoma. The SGP site is the largest and most extensive climate research field site in the world and can be viewed as a real &quot;laboratory without walls.&quot;

The heart of the SGP site is the heavily instrumented central facility located on 160 acres of cattle pasture and wheat fields southeast of Lamont, Oklahoma. A staff of 30 scientists and technicians collect and monitor data from the central facility instruments and from smaller, unstaffed facilities throughout the site.

The instruments throughout the site automatically collect data on surface and atmospheric properties, routinely providing data to the Site Data System, which is linked by high-speed communications to the ARM Archive and Data Center. The External Data Center acquires additional data from other sources, such as National Weather Service satellite and surface data, and provides tailored data packages to ARM Science Team members.

More than 30 instrument clusters have been placed around the SGP site, at the Central Facility and at Boundary, Extended, and Intermediate Facilities. The locations for the instruments were chosen so that the measurements reflect conditions over the typical distribution of land uses within the site.

The continuous observations at the SGP site are supplemented by intensive observation periods, when the frequency of measurements is increased and special measurements are added to address specific research questions. During such periods, approximately 2 gigabytes or more of data (two billion bytes) is generated daily. Both during intensive observation periods and at other times, scientists bring their own specialized instruments to the SGP site, typically for several weeks.

The SGP was chosen as the first ARM field measurement site for several reasons including its relatively homogeneous geography and easy accessibility, wide variability of climate cloud type and surface flux properties, and large seasonal variation in temperature and specific humidity. It also already had a large, existing network of weather and climate research and instrumentation.",User Facility,http://www.arm.gov/sites/nsa,wanda.ferrel@science.doe.gov,(301) 903-0043

The PCMDI mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis and intercomparison of general circulation models (GCMs) that simulate the global climate. The need for innovative analysis of GCM climate simulations is apparent, as increasingly more complex models are developed, while the disagreements among these simulations and relative to climate observations remain significant and poorly understood. The nature and causes of these disagreements must be accounted for in a systematic fashion in order to confidently use GCMs for simulation of putative global climate change.
PCMDI's mission demands that we work on both scientific projects and infrastructural tasks. Our current scientific projects focus on supporting model intercomparison, on developing a model parameterization testbed, identification of robust Cloud Feedbacks in observations and models and on devising robust statistical methods for climate-change detection/attribution. Examples of ongoing infrastructural tasks include the development of software for data management, visualization, and computation ; the assembly/organization of observational data sets for model validation; and the consistent documentation of climate model features.

Centered at Barrow and extending to the south (to the vicinity of Atqasuk), west (to the vicinity of Wainwright), and east (towards Oliktok), the NSA site has become a focal point for atmospheric and ecological research activity on the North Slope. The principal instrumented facility was installed near Barrow in 1997, followed by a smaller remote site in Atqasuk in 1999, which operated through 2010.

High latitude data are being used to refine models and parameterizations as they relate to the Arctic and are receiving increasing attention as the interactions of the atmosphere-ocean climate system become better understood. In addition, other compelling scientific reasons to study climatic change at high latitudes are listed below:

Ice (including snow) is the predominant form of condensed water most of the year, both in the air and on the surface. Ice and snow scatter, transmit, and absorb sunlight and radiant heat much differently than water
There is very little water vapor in the atmosphere, changing the impact of the atmosphere on the propagation of radiant energy, particularly radiant energy propagating upwards from the surface, and on the performance of some atmospheric remote sensing instruments.
The major &quot;pumps&quot; for the global ocean currents are at high latitudes, and there is good reason to believe that those pumps will be affected by climate-related changes in the atmosphere.
